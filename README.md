# cloud-computing-lab-terraform
Infra provisioned by Terraform in Google Cloud

### Prerequisites

* Gcloud CLI
* Kubectl

**Config Gcloud CLI**  
Be authenticated using the commands below.  
*infrastructure is provisioned in `europe-west2` region. You can use your desired region by adjusting the `TF_VAR_region` variable in the main workflow

```bash
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login   
```

### Create bcs to support remote terraform state on GCP. 

Bucket name must be globally unique. You can use a bucket name that contains the project id e.g `terraform-state-<project_id>`

```bash
gsutil mb -p <project_id> -c <storage_class> -l <region> gs://<bucket_name>
```

Enable remote state versioning (optional)

```bash
gsutil versioning set on gs://<bucket_name>
```

### Google APIs and IAM Roles

1. Create a new service account for Terraform, add a new KEY, download the generated JSON file with the service account credentials.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create <serviceAccountName> --project <project_id>
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=<serviceAccount.email>
```

2.Assign required roles to the new service account
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_id> --member='serviceAccount:<serviceAccount.email>' --role='roles/storage.admin'   
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_id> --member='serviceAccount:<serviceAccount.email>' --role='roles/storage.objectAdmin'   
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project_id> --member='serviceAccount:<serviceAccount.email>' --role='roles/compute.admin'
```

3.Enable the `Google APIs`. Make sure that gcloud is configured with the right project
```bash
gcloud config set project <project_id>
```

```bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iap.googleapis.com
```

### Provision Infra using GitOps

1. Enable Github workflows, navigate to the **Actions** page of the repository and enable the main workflow.
2. Encode the file's content in `BASE64` format and store it as a secret named `GCP_TF_SA_CREDS_BASE64` on GitHub, in a new Github environment with protection rules is preferred. See the following [link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) for setting a new Github environment.
If you do so, make sure that the right environment is defined in the main workflow.

```bash
name: Infra managed by terraform

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: <your_new_environment>
    steps:
      - name: provisioning
        # ...provisioning-specific steps
```

```bash
cat key.json | base64
```
or using the [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/) online

2. Set the required tf_variables in the main workflow. **Note** environment variables must have the `TF_VAR_` prefix in order to be visible in the Terraform code.            


3. Push your changes. You can use the Github workflow status page to monitor the progress of the workflow.

### Provision Infra using Terraform

1. Move the credentials (plain json file) of the service account to the root path of the project         


2. Create the `variables.auto.tfvars` file and set the following variables inside

```bash
credentials        = "./credentials.json"
project_id         = "project_id"
region             = "region"
zone               = "zone"
name               = "workspace_name"
```

### Terraform usage

```bash
# Fetch terraform resources
terraform init

# Check the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply

# Destroy Infrastructure
terraform destroy
```

The `--auto-approve` option tells Terraform not to require interactive approval of the plan before applying it e.g `terraform apply --auto-approve`
